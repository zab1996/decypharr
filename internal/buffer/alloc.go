// Background unmapper. munmap is a TLB-shootdown syscall; on Linux it can stall
// for tens of microseconds and, worse, the eviction path calls put() while the
// owning Buffer holds its exclusive lock (dropBlockLocked runs under b.mu).
// Running the syscall there stalls every waiting reader — the tail-latency
// regression vs the old sync.Pool, whose Put never syscalls. Handing overflow
// blocks to a shared goroutine keeps the lock holder off the syscall: the pages
// are still released promptly (the queue drains continuously), only the *timing*
// moves off the critical path, so deterministic RAM release is preserved.

// maxReuseBlocks caps how many freed blocks a blockAllocator keeps on hand
// for reuse. The free list exists only to absorb steady-state churn —
// where every eviction is immediately followed by a load of the next block
// — so it can stay small. Anything freed beyond this is unmapped at once,
// which is what makes a shrinking working set actually return RAM. 8 blocks
// = 8 MB of reuse headroom per Buffer, more than enough for sequential
// streaming's evict-then-load cadence.

// blockAllocator hands out fixed blockSize buffers and returns them to the

//
// It replaces the per-Buffer sync.Pool. A sync.Pool only releases its
// contents lazily — entries survive until a GC, and the freed heap pages
// return to the OS later still, on the scavenger's schedule (MADV_FREE).
// Under many concurrent streams that lag let RSS climb into OOM territory.
// This allocator instead frees via munmapBlock the moment a block falls out
// of the small reuse window, so memory tracks the live working set closely
// without relying on GC pacing or GOMEMLIMIT.
//
// get/put are currently only called with the owning Buffer's mu held, but the
// allocator carries its own mutex so that contract isn't load-bearing. Lock
// order is always Buffer.mu -> blockAllocator.mu; the allocator never reaches
// back for Buffer.mu, so this can't deadlock.
